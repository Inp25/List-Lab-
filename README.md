# List-Lab-
This program practices working with lists using four functions.
Series 1 adds user input to a fruit list, lets the user select a fruit by number, adds items to the beginning, and prints fruits that start with “P”.
Series 2 removes fruits from the list, including user-chosen items, duplicates the list, and removes all occurrences of a selected fruit.
Series 3 asks the user if they like each fruit and builds a new list containing only the fruits they like.
Series 4 creates a list with each fruit name reversed and removes the last item from the original list.
The main function runs all four parts in order.
